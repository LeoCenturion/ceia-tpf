#AI add a martingale strategy. Process target as 1 if the next hour's is greater and 0 otherwise. The martingale strategy is: bet x ammount. If next period's price is greater then cash out and bet x ammount again. If next period's price is lower then double the ammount previously bet.
# implement a strategy like in `strategy_runner.py` AI!
